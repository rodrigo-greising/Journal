# MVP Overview

## Core Concept
A web-based application designed for both mobile and desktop platforms that enables patients to input unstructured data through text or audio for journaling and activity documentation. The application serves multiple healthcare use cases including nutrition tracking and addiction treatment trigger identification.

## Key Requirements

### Patient Input Interface
- **Primary Focus**: Input-first design prioritizing ease of use
- **Accessibility**: Must be usable during high-stress situations (e.g., panic attacks)
- **Input Methods**: 
  - Text-based journaling
  - Audio recording capabilities
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform web application (mobile and desktop)

### Data Processing & Analysis
- **Cloud Integration**: Leverage cloud APIs to structure unstructured data
- **Data Conversion**: Transform natural language input into structured numerical data for visualization
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze journal entries to identify patterns and triggers
- **Use Case Examples**:
  - Addiction treatment trigger detection
  - Nutrition pattern analysis
  - Mental health trend identification

### Patient Dashboard
- **Data Visualization**: Present structured data through graphs and charts
- **Analytics Display**: Show insights derived from journal analysis
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear, accessible dashboard for patient review

## Technical Considerations

### Visualization Strategy
- **Leverage Existing Solutions**: Utilize established graphing libraries rather than building custom visualizations
- **Trigger Visualization**: Evaluate multiple approaches:
  - Word cloud representations
  - Textual analysis summaries
  - Hybrid approaches
- **Testing Requirements**: A/B testing necessary to determine optimal visualization methods for different use cases
