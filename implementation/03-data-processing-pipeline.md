# User Story: Data Processing Pipeline

## Story
As a healthcare provider, I want unstructured patient journal entries (text/audio) to be automatically processed into structured data so that I can analyze patterns and provide better care.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Text entries are processed through NLP APIs to extract structured data
- [ ] Audio entries are transcribed to text then processed
- [ ] Structured data includes sentiment, keywords, and health-relevant entities
- [ ] Processing happens asynchronously without blocking user interface
- [ ] Users receive feedback when processing is complete
- [ ] Failed processing attempts are retried with error logging

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate cloud NLP APIs (AWS Comprehend, OpenAI, etc.)
- Implement speech-to-text for audio entries
- Design data schema for structured output
- Add job queue for background processing
- Implement error handling and retry logic

## Priority
High - Essential for healthcare value

## Dependencies
- Cloud API integrations
- Database schema design
- Audio recording functionality

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 weeks)
