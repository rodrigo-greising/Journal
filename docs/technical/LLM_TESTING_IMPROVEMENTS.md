# LLM Testing Framework Improvements

## ‚úÖ **Major Improvements Implemented**

### **1. Realistic & Varied Test Data** üéØ

**Enhanced Test Profiles** (`src/testing/improved-test-data.profiles.ts`):
- **Varied language**: No repetitive patterns, natural human expression
- **Mixed entry lengths**: From short notes (e.g., "Day 1. Hands shaking.") to detailed paragraphs
- **Realistic emotional progression**: Authentic addiction recovery, nutrition, and mental health journeys
- **Time series integrity**: Proper date offsets showing realistic progression over 30 days

**Example Improvements**:
```
OLD: "Day 1 of sobriety. Feeling anxious but determined."
NEW: "Day 1. Hands shaking. Made eggs and toast. Dave destroyed my presentation today - felt my chest get tight, wanted a drink so bad. Called Sarah instead."
```

### **2. Contextual LLM Prompts with Measurement Scales** üìè

**Mood Analysis Context**:
```
MOOD SCALE REFERENCE:
10/10: Euphoric, ecstatic, peak happiness, boundless joy
9/10: Very happy, elated, excellent mood, highly positive
8/10: Happy, good mood, optimistic, content
...
2/10: Very low, depressed, significant distress
1/10: Severely depressed, hopeless, crisis level
```

**Energy Analysis Context**:
```
ENERGY SCALE REFERENCE:
10/10: Peak energy, boundless vitality, could run a marathon
9/10: Very high energy, highly motivated, very active
...
SLEEP QUALITY SCALE (when mentioned):
10/10: Perfect sleep, woke up completely refreshed
```

### **3. Food Groups Instead of Individual Foods** ü•ó

**Nutrition Analysis Improvements**:
- **Standardized food groups**: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, etc.
- **Calorie estimation guidelines**: Light meal (200-400), moderate (400-700), large (700+)
- **Contextual prompts**: Clear definitions for each food category

**Schema Update**:
```typescript
// OLD
foodMentions: string[];

// NEW
foodGroups: string[]; // Uses standardized categories
```

### **4. Consistency Testing Framework** üîÑ

**New Endpoints** (`/consistency/`):
- `POST /consistency/test/mood` - Test mood analysis consistency
- `POST /consistency/test/energy` - Test energy analysis consistency
- `POST /consistency/test/nutrition` - Test nutrition analysis consistency
- `POST /consistency/test/triggers` - Test trigger analysis consistency
- `POST /consistency/test/all` - Comprehensive consistency testing
- `POST /consistency/test/preset/:profileName` - Test with predefined entries

**Consistency Metrics**:
- **Mood Scale Variance**: Measures numerical consistency (target: <2 points)
- **Sentiment Consistency**: Percentage agreement (target: >80%)
- **Emotions Overlap**: Jaccard similarity for emotion lists (target: >60%)
- **Food Groups Overlap**: Consistency in food categorization (target: >70%)

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Test mood consistency with 5 runs
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/consistency/test/mood \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Had a great day today!", "runs": 5}'

# Test all analysis types for preset entry
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/consistency/test/preset/addiction-recovery?runs=10
```

### **5. Enhanced Database Cleanup** üßπ

**Fixed PostgreSQL Foreign Key Issues**:
- Proper deletion order (child tables first)
- Uses `DELETE FROM` instead of TypeORM `delete({})` for empty criteria
- TRUNCATE with CASCADE for complete resets

### **6. Improved Test Profiles Coverage** üìä

**Three Comprehensive Profiles**:

1. **`addiction-recovery-realistic`**:
   - 30-day journey with realistic ups and downs
   - Authentic trigger situations (work stress, family crisis)
   - Varied coping strategies and social support

2. **`nutrition-tracking-detailed`**:
   - Different meal types and eating patterns
   - Realistic food descriptions with variety
   - Energy correlations with food choices

3. **`mental-health-varied`**:
   - Therapy sessions, panic attacks, coping successes
   - Diverse triggers and emotional responses
   - Realistic recovery patterns

## üöÄ **New Testing Capabilities**

### **Consistency Testing**
```bash
# Test same input 10 times to measure variance
POST /consistency/test/all
{
  "text": "Today was amazing! Had a great workout and healthy breakfast.",
  "runs": 10
}

# Returns detailed metrics:
{
  "overallConsistency": 0.85,
  "results": {
    "mood": {
      "metrics": {
        "meanMoodScale": 8.2,
        "moodScaleVariance": 0.4,
        "sentimentConsistency": 1.0,
        "emotionsConsistency": 0.8
      },
      "recommendations": ["Mood analysis consistency is acceptable."]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Profile-Based Evaluation**
```bash
# Use improved realistic test data
POST /testing/seed/clean-and-seed/addiction-recovery-realistic

# Evaluate with new food groups system
POST /evaluation/profile/nutrition-tracking-detailed
```

## üìà **Expected Quality Improvements**

### **Consistency Targets**:
- **Mood Scale Variance**: <1.5 points (improved from <2)
- **Sentiment Agreement**: >85% (improved from >80%)
- **Food Group Classification**: >80% consistency
- **Trigger Identification**: >70% overlap

### **Realistic Test Scenarios**:
- **Emotional complexity**: Mixed emotions in single entries
- **Authentic language**: Slang, incomplete sentences, stream of consciousness
- **Varied contexts**: Work stress, family issues, health challenges
- **Natural progression**: Realistic recovery/decline patterns

## üõ† **Technical Enhancements**

### **Prompt Engineering**:
- **Standardized scales**: Clear 1-10 definitions for all metrics
- **Context-rich prompts**: Detailed guidelines for each analysis type
- **Food categorization**: Systematic grouping instead of individual items

### **Evaluation Framework**:
- **Statistical analysis**: Variance, Jaccard similarity, mode calculation
- **Automated recommendations**: Specific suggestions based on metrics
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Multi-dimensional consistency assessment

### **Data Quality**:
- **Time series realism**: Proper date progression with realistic gaps
- **Language variety**: Diverse vocabulary and sentence structures
- **Contextual authenticity**: Real-world scenarios and challenges

## üéØ **Production Readiness**

The enhanced framework now provides:
- **Reliable LLM monitoring** with consistency benchmarks
- **Realistic evaluation scenarios** for healthcare contexts
- **Actionable insights** for prompt optimization
- **Scalable testing infrastructure** for continuous quality assurance

This implementation ensures robust LLM performance validation for the healthcare journaling application with industry-standard consistency requirements and realistic user scenarios.
